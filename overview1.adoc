Rationale

It would be nice if every kind of numeric software could be written in
C++ without loss of efficiency, but unless something can be found that
achieves this without compromising the C++ type system it may be
preferable to rely on Fortran, assembler or architecture-specific
extensions (Bjarne Stroustrup).

This C++ library is directed towards scientific computing on the level
of basic linear algebra constructions with matrices and vectors and
their corresponding abstract operations. The primary design goals were:

* mathematical notation
* efficiency
* functionality
* compatibility

Another intention was to evaluate, if the abstraction penalty resulting
from the use of such matrix and vector classes is acceptable.

The development of this library was guided by a couple of similar
efforts:

BLAS seems to be the most widely used library for basic linear algebra
constructions, so it could be called a de-facto standard. Its interface
is procedural, the individual functions are somewhat abstracted from
simple linear algebra operations. Due to the fact that is has been
implemented using Fortran and its optimizations, it also seems to be one
of the fastest libraries available. As we decided to design and
implement our library in an object-oriented way, the technical
approaches are distinct. However anyone should be able to express BLAS
abstractions in terms of our library operators and to compare the
efficiency of the implementations.

Blitz++ is an impressive library implemented in C++. Its main design
seems to be oriented towards multidimensional arrays and their
associated operators including tensors. The author of Blitz++
